#Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 


# Subject
 
 Encodes volunteers by integers 1:30
 
# Activity

Activities performed by volunteers 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

# Variables

Average over the mean and standard deviation of accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial signals. 
't' denotes time and 'f' frequency
The acceleration signal is in standard gravity units 'g'.
The angular velocity vector is measured in radians/second.
